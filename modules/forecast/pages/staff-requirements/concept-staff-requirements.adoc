Staff requirements specify the number of people needed to handle a planning unit's activities in a given period.
The calculation of staff requirements is the final step in the forecasting process.
Once complete, the requirements data can be used by scheduling features such as:

* Create optimized schedule
* Job optimization
* Optimize breaks

Peopleware generates staff requirement data in two ways:

* A continuous, automated process based on your forecast
* Specific, manually triggered calculations

[#automatic-requirement-calculations]
== Automatic requirement calculations

Automatic requirement calculations are set up per workload in {bc-forecast-workloads}.
Once set up, they continuously provide staff requirement data based on input such as forecasted contact volume and AHT.
The data required for the calculation is stored in queues in {bc-analyze-configuration}.
Queues have the name of the corresponding workload with a leading asterisk, for example `*yourWorkloadName`.

The calculation is automatic, but the data is not available for scheduling until someone saves the calculated requirements for a defined period.
This gives planners full control over when new forecast data becomes relevant for scheduling.

Characteristics of automatic requirement calculations:

* *Trigger*: Automatic and continuous
* *Scope*: Every forecast version of a workload and any period
* *Purpose*: Provide baseline staff requirement data continuously

[#manual-requirement-calculations]
== Manual requirement calculations

You can trigger requirement calculations manually in {bc-forecast-requirementcalculations}.
Manual calculations are performed for a specific period and use parameters set up for that run.
Use them when automatic calculations cannot model a specific scenario.

Characteristics of manual requirement calculations:

* *Trigger*: Manual
* *Scope*: Varies, but always covers a specific period
* *Purpose*: Address unique staffing needs, model scenarios, or make targeted adjustments

[#calculation-methods]
== Calculation methods

Peopleware supports several calculation methods to determine staff requirements:

* *Erlang-C*: Calculates the staff needed to answer a certain volume of calls within a target service level, for example 80% of calls answered within 20 seconds.
* *Chat*: Extends Erlang-C for concurrent chat sessions and lets you define the number of simultaneous chats an agent can handle.
* *Linear*: Suitable for work that does not happen in real time, such as emails, letters, or back-office tasks.

Automatic calculations always apply one of these methods.
Depending on the purpose, manual calculations use one of these methods or other approaches to calculate a result.
