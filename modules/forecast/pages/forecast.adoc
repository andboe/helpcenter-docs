*Forecast* applies machine learning to your historical data to generate high-quality forecasts and find trends, patterns, and fluctuations included in your data.

*Forecast* generates a forecast for the following time ranges:

* Advanced and Enterprise WFM plans: 24 months after the data import
* Classic and Essential WFM plans: 12 months after the data import

[#generate-a-forecast]
== Generate a forecast

Check our quick start guide to learn how to xref:getting-started:calculate-a-forecast.adoc[generate a forecast].

Forecasts are updated automatically at least once a week.
Manual changes will typically be applied after several minutes.
For bulk data uploads, forecasts are recalculated if the data introduces a significant change (e.g. adding more than a week of new data or large differences in the existing data).

[#data-requirements]
== Data requirements

*Forecast* requires that you import offered contacts, average handling time (AHT), and handled contacts.

A forecast can be generated from a workload with just a few days of historical data.
To identify monthly patterns, at least one month of historical data is required.
For yearly patterns, at least a year of historical data is required.

Which kind of workloads are available to you depends on your WFM plan (Classic, Essential, Advanced or Enterprise WFM).

[#how-to-deal-with-low-data-quality]
== How to deal with low data quality

To generate an accurate forecast, historical data must be both complete (enough data with as few gaps as possible) and clean (free of irrelevant patterns). For example, incorrectly marked xref:forecast:events-and-holidays.adoc[events or public holidays] will impact forecast quality.

Historical data may include prolonged outages, or it may miss data for a particular timeframe. 
The closer that missing data is to the current day, the less the forecast quality is affected.

Here are some tips on managing low data quality depending on how long the period with poor or missing data is:

|===
|Timeframe with poor quality data
|Tip

|A few days
|Use xref:forecast:events-and-holidays.adoc[events] to mark the affected days as an outage and exclude them from the calculation.

|A couple of weeks
|Upload additional data without gaps or irrelevant patterns.

|Several weeks or months
|Remove the data that predates the gap. 
Import only the data from after the gap.

|===

[NOTE]
====
If you cannot upload additional data or you do not have enough data after a gap, the negative impact of missing data is automatically minimized.
Check and clean up data before you import it.
You cannot remove historical data.
Contact your Customer Success team if needed.

[#forecast-low-volumes]
== Forecast low volumes

*Forecast* can generate forecasts for low and high contact volumes.
When generating a forecast based on data from low contact volumes, daily patterns may not be recognized.
While rare, this may result in no forecast being generated for particular days.
For single days, adjust the forecast manually.
In a recurring situation, you can:

* Add multiple queues to the workload (resulting in higher volumes).
* Use another approach to generate staff requirements for scheduling, e.g. xref:forecast:constant-requirement-script.adoc[generate constant staff requirements].
